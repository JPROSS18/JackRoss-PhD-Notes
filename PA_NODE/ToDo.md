File Containing ToDo list:

1. How save networks 
2. Fix plotting twice on interact
3. extend training code to trajectories of varing length. 
2. PA-Node on Lorenz 



Main: 
1. Implement Parareal into the PA-NODE (done)
2. Custom loss function? (done)
3. Learn with fixed partition vs moving - Does partition improve performance (done)

2. Learn lorenz between two parameters 
3. Learn Lorenz between multiple parameters. 
4. Trajectories of varying length?

Minor: 

1. How to save network 
2. Fix plotting twice on interact 

3. Improved python plots 
- animations ?
-  
4.
