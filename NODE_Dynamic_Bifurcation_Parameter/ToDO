I want to learning a function of the form $\dot x = f(x(t), r(t))$. 

 Code to learn dynamic bifurcation (still in progress)
 Vary network size (did nothing)

 1. Learing hopf bifurcation (static param) (done)
 2. Learn limit cycle (linear dynamic param ) (done)
 
 3. Learn hopf bifurcation (linear dynamic b-param)
 4. Learn Lorenz (non chaotic) - static param 
 5. Learn Lorenz (linear dynamic param)


3. Optimise neural odes for speed
-adjoint vs not 
- wrapper vs in forward.
