Deep Learning Model Proposed in (Huang et al., 2024) to distinguish between types of tipping and forecast their probability. 

>“We prospect that a comprehensive DL model could be taken to provide precursor signals across diverse tipping phenomena and systems, as well as distinguish between them in terms of their different forcing scenarios, purely based on the data.” (Huang et al., 2024, p. 1562) 


Paper which combined variational autoencoder + reservoir computing can detect bifurcations + separate models can detect rate induced tipping. 

#### Current Project: 

Investigate if the classification presented in [[huangDeepLearningPredicting2024 | (Huang et al., 2024)| ]] can extended to extrapolating across critical transitions. Use NODE approach similar to [[tegelenNeuralOrdinaryDifferential2025| (Tegelen et al., 2025)]]

#### Other Ideas: 

Method to detect critical transitions approach from seminar (Investigate further)

Early warning statistic in rate induced tipping. 

Ergodic theory and bifurcations.
