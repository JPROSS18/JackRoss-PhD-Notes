A set is **pre-compact** if its closure is compact (relatively compact)

A set can also be said to be pre-compact if it can be covered by finitely many open sets for every fixed size - totally bounded set. 

Definitions coincide on complete metric spaces. 

In $\mathbb{R}^n$, precompact corresponds to bounded open sets (I believe).
