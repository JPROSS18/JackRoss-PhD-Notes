Learn an evolution with consistent with evolution - answer questions about dynamic without it. 

RDS vs ODE/PDE/SDE

**RDS**

Example of na sytem.

(Look at skew product)

Stationary distribituon - does not fully describe 

Is it markivian? 

Takens embedding on IFS learns to recover original dynamics- too many maps 

Partial Observations - Delay Embedding - Original Markov Chain - Embedding with correct maps

New Model which is differomorhoc 

- CTS noise (in preparation)
- SDE
- Discover RDS from data
- Use RDS theory
