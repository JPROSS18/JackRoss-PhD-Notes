Abstract for AAAI 2023 Spring Symposium Series ACTD Submission.  

They claim their methods can be effective at predicting future tipping point transitions and, in some cases, post tipping dynamics. They note this is not the case in other cases. 

I cannot find work any published work on this. D. Patel's PhD Thesis (2024) contains a chapter on "Using Machine Learning to Anticipate Tipping Points and Extrapolate to Post-Tipping Dynamics of Non-Stationary Dynamical Systems"
