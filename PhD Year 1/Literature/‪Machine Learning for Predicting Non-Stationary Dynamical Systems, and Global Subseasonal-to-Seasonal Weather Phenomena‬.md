Full thesis of Dhruvit Patel. 

Interested in Chapter 2: "Using Machine Learning To Predict Statistical Properties of Non-Stationary Dynamical Processes: System Climate, Regime Transitions, and the Effect of Stochasticity" and Chapter 3: "Predicting the Tipping Point and Post-Tipping-Point Dynamics in Non-Stationary Systems".

[[Reservoir Computing ]]is exclusively used. They give the reservoir the time evolution of parameter. For Lorenz equations the model is given the time evolution of $\rho$ along with training data. 

No real data used, stochastic Lorenz equations used. 

How well do they predict tipping?
