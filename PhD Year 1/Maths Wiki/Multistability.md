Magnetic Pendulum 

Eigenvalues are independent of 'attractiveness', as its local
Fraction of phase space. 

Linear measures: 
Based on eigen values

Non-linear measures:

- Nonlocal
- Sampling distributions matters ? 

1. Characteristic return time
2. Reactivity: Initial speed of perturbation growth 
3. Maximal amplification: Maximal growth of a perturbation.

**Geometrical:**
**Critical Shocks**
1. Critical shock - shock large enough to to move about of basin of attraction
2. Maximal non-critical shock
3. Average critical shock magnitude. 

L
fraction of state spce in b o A

**Transient:**
Derived by the dynamical flow as i.c. convergence to attractors. 

1. Convergence time
2. Convergence pace
3. Finite time basin stability - IC that return with time T

Should take in how attractive each direction is (just how far). 


Critical slowing down exist for a llong time 
Do other measure scale similarly ? Depend on bifurcation

**Median return time? Is critical slowing down better?**



Complexity measure: Care about ordering/ not distribution 
Permutation entropy

Are the entropy measures used on time series or different autonoumous systems?
