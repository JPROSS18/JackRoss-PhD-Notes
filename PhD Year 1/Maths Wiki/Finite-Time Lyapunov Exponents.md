Attempts to use finite-time Lyapunov exponents to understand exponential features in deep neural networks. 

# Definition
Maximal Lyapunov Exponent is defined as: 
$$
\lambda = \lim_{t \to \infty } \lim_{|\delta_0| \to 0} \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{\delta(t)}{\delta_0}
$$
In contrast, the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) is defined as:
$$
\lambda(x_t) = 
$$

# In Deep Neural Networks

> [!quote] As the width of the network increases, the contrast between (FTLE) ridge and background disappears, leading to a different learning mechanism, random embedding, with qualitative differences regarding classification errors and predictive uncertainties. - (Storm et al., 2024)
