General Page to record information related to learning dynamical systems using neural ODE/ other purely data driven methods. 

The standard approach to machine learning minimised an L2 or L1 loss, which often does not capture underlying dynamics. For example, learning a fixed point with incorrect rate convergence/ incorrect lyapunov exponents. 



# Chaotic Systems

[[ chakrabortyDivideConquerLearning2024 | Chakraborty et al (2024)]] applied a multistep penalty method to neural ODE's for accurate forecasting of chaotic systems.
