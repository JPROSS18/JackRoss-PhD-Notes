#### Meeting Notes

Discuss project progress from overleaf. 
- Recap of ideas from meetings with Jean Julien 
- Discuss Neural ODE work + learning deterministic case 

Future Ideas to discuss:
- Classification of critical transitions preprint 
- Dynamics of tipping, could it be purely stochastic 
- KAN networks 

Meeting Summary: 
Discussed work, identified next steps 
- Add learnable break points + learn more complex dynamics
- Learn Stochastic dynamics 
- KAN networks not great direction - symbolic dynamics less interesting 

Questions: 
Does optimal breakpoints align with optimal piecewise linear functions? 
Learning latent parameters?
#### Monday 

Fixed for learning non-auto ode directly ( lorenz system code - added batching + gradient saving)

#### Tuesday 
Learned simple dynamics with single fixed break point + wrote up _
Read about SINDy and KAN networks + Wrote up updates. 

#### Wednesday 
Transitions over saddles class + learnt simple dynamics code + included in summary. 
MIT deep learning class 
#### Thursday
