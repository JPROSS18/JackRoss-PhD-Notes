#### Meeting Notes



***
#### Weekly Plan

For general development, I need to install and learn the basics of PyTorch and Julia. 
I need to look into the best way to learn linux on my laptop.

Continue Reading various relevant papers. For specific goals I need to 

Read about rate induced tipping and find sources about learning/predicting rate induced tipping. Small literature review of this area. 

Try to learning non-autonomous systems

#### Monday
Meeting with Supervisors went well. Discussed current literature relating to ml for detecting critical transitions. 

In particular we discussed R-tipping classification in (Huang et al., 2024) and extrapolating past bifurcation points in (Tegelen et al., 2025). 

Goal for the rest of the next while to try to replication results in (Tegelen et al., 2025).

Spent rest of the day on NDE's
