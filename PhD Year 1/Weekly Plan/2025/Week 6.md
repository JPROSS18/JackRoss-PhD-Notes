#### Meeting Notes

Topics: 
- Neural ODE prediction (chaos reservoir computing )
- Rate Induced tipping thesis
- Model from Jean-Julien Aucouturier paper 
- Hysteric tipping prediction 
- Laptop/conferences
- 

Discussed NODE prediction of the Lorenz systems with a varying $\rho$. 

Noted that I should show the network can learn that the system has no dependence on $t$ and that model should be able learn to interpolate between $r$ values. 

- Noted that I should withhold a portion of $r$ at random as a test set to prevent data leaking. 
- Look into learning SDE's
