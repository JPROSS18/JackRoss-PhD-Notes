Supervisor Meeting on Monday. Discuss relevant literature to get develop a more clear direction.

#### Meeting Notes

No work to present so discussed papers learning bifurcations.


Discussed paper where[[Bifurcation]] diagrams were learned by [[Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)]] and [[Transformers]]. Noted that both only study autonomous systems.

We discussed rate-induced tipping and Martin noted a previous PhD student of his believed that it was not possible to predict prior to onset. He suggested I look into if would be possible with more modern machine learning methods. 

It was discussed that learning autonomous systems is possible, suggested to investigate UDE's for this purpose. It was noted by Martin that the ability to divide into time intervals with similar dynamics and classify accordingly would be significant. A long term goal would be to investigate if a machine learning reconstruction can be used to determine how close a system is to a critical transition.

It was suggested that I attempt to learn a toy system with a dynamic varying parameter, such a a Lorenz system with varying $\rho$.

#### Weekly Plan

For general development, I need to install and learn the basics of PyTorch and Julia. 
I need to look into the best way to learn linux on my laptop.

Continue Reading various relevant papers. For specific goals I need to 

Read about rate induced tipping and find sources about learning/predicting rate induced tipping. Small literature review of this area. 

Try to learning non-autonomous systems
