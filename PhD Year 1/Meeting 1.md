What is the recommended amount to hours for a manageable workload. Martingale limits to 6 hours. 

2. Seminars 
What Seminars should I go to ? 
When and where are they? Where can I find information about them
Are there reading groups I should join. 

3. Research Expenses outline
I have £3000 pounds research expenses for first year and £2000 for subsequent years. Can these funds be carried to future years?

What will I need to spend these funds on? 
Laptop, technology, books, printing
Travel to conference/summer school.

What is the process for claiming these funds?
