A general page to collect information for measure theoretic concepts which arise in studying dynamical systems. 


**The Invariant Measure:**

An invariant Measure is a measure that is preserved by some function. 

Ergodic Theory is the study of invariant measures in dynamical systems - space of ergodic measures is a subset of invariant measures. 



Let $(X, \Sigma)$ be a measurable space and $f: X \to X$ is a measurable function. 

A measure $\mu$ is invariant under $f$  if for every measurable set $A$ in $\Sigma$:
$$
\mu(f^{-1}(A) ) = \mu (A)
$$
When a transfer operator exist, the eigenvector correspoding to eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = 1$ is the invariant measure.

Different regions will have different invariant measures (different dynamics).

Ergodic Measure are indecomposable invariant measure. They cannot be written a convex combination of other invariant measures. 

Thought: Ergdoic/Mixing  -> invarinat measure systems not necessarily.
